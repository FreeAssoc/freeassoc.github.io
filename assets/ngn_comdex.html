    <BR><BR> CHICAGO--(ENTERTAINMENT WIRE)--April 19, 1999-- <BR><BR> Next Generation Network (NGN), www.ngn.com, known for their thousands of targeted digital video monitors found in brand-name retail locations, fast-food restaurants, gas stations and office lobbies around the country, has won a first-place award in the WindowsWorld Open competition at the 1999 Spring COMDEX&nbsp;trade show and exhibition in Chicago. <BR><BR> The announcement was made by Microsoft CEO&nbsp;Bill Gates&nbsp;and Tom Pugliese, CEO of NGN. <BR><BR> NGN executives present to accept the award were: Carol A. Lundstrom, executive vice president; Michael C. Murray, chief technology officer; Brian Walker, MIS director; Susan Jorgenson, software engineer; and Chris Theiste, software engineer. <BR><BR> "It's exciting to see how well advertisers and retail partners have grown with NGN and taken advantage of our sophisticated custom applications. This award caps a year in which NGN's National Network has grown to more than five million viewers daily," said Carol A. Lundstrom, who has been with the company since its inception. <BR><BR> The WindowsWorld Open is an international competition recognizing the best in Windows development. NGN received the award in the "Communications" category of the competition. This particular award recognizes applications that focus on the core businesses of broadcast or cable TV, print media, telecommunications or information services. <BR><BR> The contest accepts submissions from companies who have created an innovative custom application developed to meet a challenge specific to a particular business. NGN's application is unprecedented in that they can dynamically change content network-wide within hours and target campaigns to individual markets or locations. <BR><BR> For example, when UPN&nbsp;debuted their new animated series "Dilbert," they utilized NGN to promote the show specific to each market. NGN can direct their content on the internet or any other IP-based transport. <BR><BR> "We are honored and excited to be the recipients of this award," said Pugliese from the company's headquarters in Minneapolis. "Since NGN was founded in 1990, we have taken great pride in the quality and creativity of the services we offer. A recognition of this kind gives us a tremendous sense of accomplishment as NGN moves into the 21st Century." <BR><BR> Next Generation Network, www.ngn.com, is fast becoming an important source of weather, sports and news to America's increasingly mobile and time constrained public. Also known as "InLine TV", this innovative digital media network is watched by more than 5 million "on-the-go" consumers every day when they are out of their homes and performing their daily routines. <BR><BR> NGN's video monitors are an excellent vehicle for advertisers, due to the company's high-tech digital delivery system that allows content to be specifically targeted to the desired audience as well as changed locally or network-wide within hours. <BR><BR> NGN's quick expansion has grown to include offices in 18 local television markets, among them New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Washington, DC and Tampa-St. Petersburg. Look for NGN's video displays at local convenience stores, fast food restaurants, gas stations and movie theaters. <BR><BR> This news release may include statements that constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor&nbsp;provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act&nbsp;of 1995.
